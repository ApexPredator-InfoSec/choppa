Shellcode chopper
This is a simple tool to chop up shellcode. I previous did a challenge that required using write primitives to copy over shellcode to a memory location. You could implement the same process with in a python exploit using loops to make it more streamlined and smaller file size or you can use this to spit out your write/what/where with shellcode in 8-byte chunks. Chunk size and functions/variables can all be edited to meet the needs of the challenge being worked.
